# radio_delay
A simple project to delay a sports radio broadcast to sync up with TV

This was implemented with a Raspberry Pi using a Sabrent USB Audio Stereo Sound Adapter (model AU-MMSA), the Linux alsa audio package, and the Python module pyalsaaudio.

## Setup

### Installing alsa and pyalsaaudio

sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
sudo -H pip3 install pyalsaaudio
